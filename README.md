Arduino christmas countdown clock

This is a clock using a 16x2 LCD panel that counts the days and hours left until christmas.

The code also uses 3 button inputs to traverse the settings, change the current time and date, and start the timer.

I have noticed that something strange has happened to the code on both my machine AND the repository.  I don't know what happened, but I seem to be missing a large chunk of the code that I have written.  I think one of my cats took a walk on my keyboard.  I need to re-write this code anyway to make it more readable, and I will update this eventually when it's fixed.
